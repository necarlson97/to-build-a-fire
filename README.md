# to-build-a-fire
A unity game made in 48hrs for ludum dare #50 - A bit of 'Surgeon Simulator', a dash of 'Little Inferno', a smidge of 'The Long Dark'.  
Inspired by the 1902 short story by Jack London.

This campfire will be your grave, you know this.
Can you build a fire, while the frigid wind howls, and your fingers blacken?

Like all my games, its rough, ugly, and weird - but I’m proud of what I experimented with this one.
